# Translating-two-dimensional-notations-into-animated-3D-scenes
This project is about the translation of two-dimensional print derivatives to spatial 3D scenes. The focus of this thesis is the realization of notated motions of paper models in 3D scenes by means of X3D.  Especially, this thesis develops a systematic method to produce the data required to control the motions of paper models.
